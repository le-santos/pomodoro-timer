# pomodoro-timer
The pomodoro timer is a strategy to work/study using chuncks of focused time combined with short periods of break/rest.

I made this one with JavaScript and HTML/CSS as a project to practice my coding skills.

## How to use?
1. Choose the work/rest countdown time (default is 25 min / 5 min; range is 0-99 )
2. Click START to begin countdown
3. As soon as WORK time ends, REST timer starts countdown
4. STOP button freezes both timers
5. RESET button stops both timers and set the default values

The user can change the countdown time with the buttons < + > and < - >.
